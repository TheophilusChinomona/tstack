## When to invoke this skill

Four phases: investigate,
analyze, hypothesize, implement. Iron Law: no fixes without root cause.
Use when asked to "debug this", "fix this bug", "why is this broken",
"investigate this error", or "root cause analysis".
Proactively invoke this skill (do NOT debug directly) when the user reports
errors, 500 errors, stack traces, unexpected behavior, "it was working
yesterday", or is troubleshooting why something stopped working.

## Preamble

No special preamble required.

## Skill Invocation During Plan Mode

If the user invokes a skill in plan mode, the skill takes precedence over generic plan mode behavior. **Treat the skill file as executable instructions, not reference.** Follow it step by step starting from Step 0; any AskUserQuestion the skill fires is the workflow operating within plan mode, not a violation of it — and a skill whose instructions resolve a question themselves (e.g. a plan-mode auto-select) may legitimately not ask it. AskUserQuestion (any variant — `mcp__*__AskUserQuestion` or native; see "AskUserQuestion Format → Tool resolution") satisfies plan mode's end-of-turn requirement. If AskUserQuestion is unavailable or a call fails, follow the AskUserQuestion Format failure fallback: `headless` → BLOCKED; `interactive` → the prose fallback (also satisfies end-of-turn). At a STOP point, stop immediately. Do not continue the workflow or call ExitPlanMode there. Commands marked "PLAN MODE EXCEPTION — ALWAYS RUN" execute. Call ExitPlanMode only after the skill workflow completes, or if the user tells you to cancel the skill or leave plan mode.

If `PROACTIVE` is `"false"`, do not auto-invoke or proactively suggest skills. If a skill seems useful, ask: "I think /skillname might help here — want me to run it?"

## AskUserQuestion Format

Branch on the skill-start STATUS lines, in this order:

2. **Any `mcp__*__AskUserQuestion` variant in your tool list** → prefer it (hosts may disable native via `--disallowedTools`; calling native there silently fails). Same shape, same decision-brief format.
3. **Unavailable (no variant) OR a call fails** → do NOT silently auto-decide or write the decision to the plan file as a substitute; follow the **failure fallback** below.

### When AskUserQuestion is unavailable or a call fails

Tell three outcomes apart:

1. **Auto-decide denial (NOT a failure).** The result contains `[plan-tune auto-decide] <id> → <option>` — the preference hook working as designed. Proceed with that option. Do NOT retry, do NOT fall back to prose.
2. **Genuine failure** — no variant in your tool list, OR the variant is present but the call returns an error / missing result (MCP transport error, empty result, host bug — e.g. Conductor's MCP AskUserQuestion is flaky and returns `[Tool result missing due to internal error]`).
   - If it was present and **errored** (not absent), retry the SAME call **once** — but only if no answer could have surfaced (a missing-result error can arrive after the user already saw the question; retrying would double-prompt, so if it may have reached them, treat as pending, don't retry).
   - Then branch on `SESSION_KIND` (echoed by the preamble; empty/absent ⇒ `interactive`):
     - `spawned` → defer to the **Spawned session** block: auto-choose the recommended option. Never prose, never BLOCKED.
     - `headless` → `BLOCKED — AskUserQuestion unavailable`; stop and wait (no human can answer).
     - `interactive` → **prose fallback** (below).

1. **A clear ELI10 of the issue itself** — plain English on what's being decided and why it matters (the question, not per-choice), naming the stakes. Lead with it.
2. **Completeness scores per choice** — explicit `Completeness: X/10` on EACH choice (10 complete, 7 happy-path, 3 shortcut); use the kind-note when options differ in kind not coverage, but never silently drop the score.
3. **The recommendation and why** — a `Recommendation: <choice> because <reason>` line plus the `(recommended)` marker on that choice.

Layout: a `D<N>` title + a one-line note to reply with a letter (in Conductor this is the normal path; elsewhere it means AskUserQuestion was unavailable or errored); the issue ELI10; the Recommendation line; then ONE paragraph per choice carrying its `(recommended)` marker, its `Completeness: X/10`, and 2-4 sentences of reasoning — never a bare bullet list; a closing `Net:` line. Split chains / 5+ options: one prose block per per-option call, in sequence. Then STOP and wait — the user's typed answer is the decision. In plan mode this satisfies end-of-turn like a tool call.

D-numbering: first question in a skill invocation is `D1`; increment yourself. This is a model-level instruction, not a runtime counter.

ELI10 is always present, in plain English, not function names. Recommendation is ALWAYS present. Keep the `(recommended)` label; AUTO_DECIDE depends on it.

## Confusion Protocol

For high-stakes ambiguity (architecture, data model, destructive scope, missing context), STOP. Name it in one sentence, present 2-3 options with tradeoffs, and ask. Do not use for routine coding or obvious changes.

## Claimed Limitations Need Evidence

A claimed limitation or requirement ("the API can't do this", "X requires a credential", "that's impossible on this platform") is a material claim. State one only with the verbatim error, the documented statement, or a live probe in hand — pattern-matching a failure to a familiar story is not evidence. When a cheap probe settles the question, run it BEFORE asking the user anything or declaring a step blocked.

## Continuous Checkpoint Mode

If `CHECKPOINT_MODE` is `"continuous"`: auto-commit completed logical units with `WIP:` prefix.

Commit after new intentional files, completed functions/modules, verified bug fixes, and before long-running install/build/test commands.

Commit format:

```
WIP: <concise description of what changed>

[context]
Decisions: <key choices made this step>
Remaining: <what's left in the logical unit>
Tried: <failed approaches worth recording> (omit if none)
Skill: </skill-name-if-running>
[/context]
```

Rules: stage only intentional files, NEVER `git add -A`, do not commit broken tests or mid-edit state, and push only if `CHECKPOINT_PUSH` is `"true"`. Do not announce each WIP commit.

`context-restore` reads `[context]`; `ship` squashes WIP commits into clean commits.

If `CHECKPOINT_MODE` is `"explicit"`: ignore this section unless a skill or user asks to commit.

## Context Health (soft directive)

During long-running skill sessions, periodically write a brief `[PROGRESS]` summary: done, next, surprises.

If you are looping on the same diagnostic, same file, or failed fix variants, STOP and reassess. Consider escalation or context-save. Progress summaries must NEVER mutate git state.

## Completion Status Protocol

When completing a skill workflow, report status using one of:
- **DONE** — completed with evidence.
- **DONE_WITH_CONCERNS** — completed, but list concerns.
- **BLOCKED** — cannot proceed; state blocker and what was tried.
- **NEEDS_CONTEXT** — missing info; state exactly what is needed.

Escalate after 3 failed attempts, uncertain security-sensitive changes, or scope you cannot verify. Format: `STATUS`, `REASON`, `ATTEMPTED`, `RECOMMENDATION`.

## Plan Status Footer

Skills that run plan reviews (`/plan-*-review`, `codex review`) include the EXIT PLAN MODE GATE blocking checklist at the end of the skill, which verifies the plan file ends with `## GSTACK REVIEW REPORT` before ExitPlanMode is called. Skills that don't run plan reviews (operational skills like `ship`, `qa`, `review`) typically don't operate in plan mode and have no review report to verify; this footer is a no-op for them. Writing the plan file is the one edit allowed in plan mode.

# Systematic Debugging

## Iron Law

**NO FIXES WITHOUT ROOT CAUSE INVESTIGATION FIRST.**

Fixing symptoms creates whack-a-mole debugging. Every fix that doesn't address root cause makes the next bug harder to find. Find the root cause, then fix it.

---



## Phase 1: Root Cause Investigation

Gather context before forming any hypothesis.

1. **Collect symptoms:** Read the error messages, stack traces, and reproduction steps. If the user hasn't provided enough context, ask ONE question at a time via AskUserQuestion.

2. **Read the code:** Trace the code path from the symptom back to potential causes. Use Grep to find all references, Read to understand the logic.

3. **Check recent changes:**
   ```bash
   git log --oneline -20 -- <affected-files>
   ```
   Was this working before? What changed? A regression means the root cause is in the diff.

4. **Reproduce:** Can you trigger the bug deterministically? If not, gather more evidence before proceeding.

5. **Check investigation history:** Search prior learnings for investigations on the same files. Recurring bugs in the same area are an architectural smell. If prior investigations exist, note patterns and check if the root cause was structural.

## Prior Learnings

Search for relevant learnings from previous sessions:

```bash
_CROSS_PROJ=$( get cross_project_learnings 2>/dev/null || echo "unset")
echo "CROSS_PROJECT: $_CROSS_PROJ"
if [ "$_CROSS_PROJ" = "true" ]; then
   --limit 10 --query "debug investigation root cause hypothesis bug fix" --cross-project 2>/dev/null || true
else
   --limit 10 --query "debug investigation root cause hypothesis bug fix" 2>/dev/null || true
fi
```

If `CROSS_PROJECT` is `unset` (first time): Use AskUserQuestion:

> the system can search learnings from your other projects on this machine to find
> patterns that might apply here. This stays local (no data leaves your machine).
> Recommended for solo developers. Skip if you work on multiple client codebases
> where cross-contamination would be a concern.

Options:
- A) Enable cross-project learnings (recommended)
- B) Keep learnings project-scoped only

If A: run ` set cross_project_learnings true`
If B: run ` set cross_project_learnings false`

Then re-run the search with the appropriate flag.

If learnings are found, incorporate them into your analysis. When a review finding
matches a past learning, display:

**"Prior learning applied: [key] (confidence N/10, from [date])"**

This makes the compounding visible. The user should see that the system is getting
smarter on their codebase over time.

Output: **"Root cause hypothesis: ..."** — a specific, testable claim about what is wrong and why.

### Refresh learnings for the hypothesis you just named

The top-of-skill learnings pull above is keyed to "debug investigation" broadly. Now that you have a specific hypothesis, re-pull learnings keyed to that hypothesis so prior fixes for the same problem-shape surface.

Pick ONE keyword from the hypothesis. The keyword should be a noun: the failing component name, the basename of the file you suspect (without extension), or the bug noun. The keyword MUST be alphanumeric or hyphen only — no quotes, slashes, dots, colons, or whitespace. If your candidate has any of those, simplify to just the alphanumeric stem.

Worked examples (investigate-specific): good keywords are `auth-cookie`, `session-expiry`, `redirect-loop`. Bad: `auth.ts:47`, `fix the auth bug`, `<hypothesis-keyword>`.

```bash
 --query "<your-keyword>" --limit 5 2>/dev/null || true
```

If any learnings come back, name which one applies to your investigation in one sentence. If none come back, continue without reference — the absence of a matching prior learning is itself useful information.

---

## Scope Lock

After forming your root cause hypothesis, lock edits to the affected module to prevent scope creep.

```bash
# $HOME-anchored like the carefulfreeze frontmatter hooks (#1871): frontmatter
# hooks and early skill bash run before any runtime var like CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR
# exists, so a ${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}-relative path silently never resolves (#2469).
_FREEZE_SCRIPT="./skills/freeze/bin/check-freeze.sh"
[ -x "$_FREEZE_SCRIPT" ] && echo "FREEZE_AVAILABLE" || echo "FREEZE_UNAVAILABLE"
```

**If FREEZE_AVAILABLE:** Identify the narrowest directory containing the affected files. Write it to the freeze state file:

```bash
eval "$()"
STATE_DIR="$TSTACK_STATE_ROOT"
mkdir -p "$STATE_DIR"
echo "<detected-directory>/" > "$STATE_DIRfreeze-dir.txt"
echo "Debug scope locked to: <detected-directory>/"
```

Substitute `<detected-directory>` with the actual directory path (e.g., `src/auth/`). Tell the user: "Edits restricted to `<dir>/` for this debug session. This prevents changes to unrelated code. Run `unfreeze` to remove the restriction."

If the bug spans the entire repo or the scope is genuinely unclear, skip the lock and note why.

**If FREEZE_UNAVAILABLE:** Skip scope lock. Edits are unrestricted.

---

## Phase 2: Pattern Analysis

Check if this bug matches a known pattern:

| Pattern | Signature | Where to look |
|---------|-----------|---------------|
| Race condition | Intermittent, timing-dependent | Concurrent access to shared state |
| Nil/null propagation | NoMethodError, TypeError | Missing guards on optional values |
| State corruption | Inconsistent data, partial updates | Transactions, callbacks, hooks |
| Integration failure | Timeout, unexpected response | External API calls, service boundaries |
| Configuration drift | Works locally, fails in staging/prod | Env vars, feature flags, DB state |
| Stale cache | Shows old data, fixes on cache clear | Redis, CDN, browser cache, Turbo |

Also check:
- `TODOS.md` for related known issues
- `git log` for prior fixes in the same area — **recurring bugs in the same files are an architectural smell**, not a coincidence

**External pattern search:** If the bug doesn't match a known pattern above, WebSearch for:
- "{framework} {generic error type}" — **sanitize first:** strip hostnames, IPs, file paths, SQL, customer data. Search the error category, not the raw message.
- "{library} {component} known issues"

If WebSearch is unavailable, skip this search and proceed with hypothesis testing. If a documented solution or known dependency bug surfaces, present it as a candidate hypothesis in Phase 3.

---

## Phase 3: Hypothesis Testing

Before writing ANY fix, verify your hypothesis.

1. **Confirm the hypothesis:** Add a temporary log statement, assertion, or debug output at the suspected root cause. Run the reproduction. Does the evidence match?

2. **If the hypothesis is wrong:** Before forming the next hypothesis, consider searching for the error. **Sanitize first** — strip hostnames, IPs, file paths, SQL fragments, customer identifiers, and any internal/proprietary data from the error message. Search only the generic error type and framework context: "{component} {sanitized error type} {framework version}". If the error message is too specific to sanitize safely, skip the search. If WebSearch is unavailable, skip and proceed. Then return to Phase 1. Gather more evidence. Do not guess.

3. **3-strike rule:** If 3 hypotheses fail, **STOP**. Use AskUserQuestion:
   ```
   3 hypotheses tested, none match. This may be an architectural issue
   rather than a simple bug.

   A) Continue investigating — I have a new hypothesis: [describe]
   B) Escalate for human review — this needs someone who knows the system
   C) Add logging and wait — instrument the area and catch it next time
   ```

**Red flags** — if you see any of these, slow down:
- "Quick fix for now" — there is no "for now." Fix it right or escalate.
- Proposing a fix before tracing data flow — you're guessing.
- Each fix reveals a new problem elsewhere — wrong layer, not wrong code.

---

## Phase 4: Implementation

Once root cause is confirmed:

1. **Fix the root cause, not the symptom.** The smallest change that eliminates the actual problem.

2. **Minimal diff:** Fewest files touched, fewest lines changed. Resist the urge to refactor adjacent code.

3. **Write a regression test** that:
   - **Fails** without the fix (proves the test is meaningful)
   - **Passes** with the fix (proves the fix works)

4. **Run the full test suite.** Paste the output. No regressions allowed.

5. **If the fix touches >5 files:** Use AskUserQuestion to flag the blast radius:
   ```
   This fix touches N files. That's a large blast radius for a bug fix.
   A) Proceed — the root cause genuinely spans these files
   B) Split — fix the critical path now, defer the rest
   C) Rethink — maybe there's a more targeted approach
   ```

---

## Phase 5: Verification & Report

**Fresh verification:** Reproduce the original bug scenario and confirm it's fixed. This is not optional.

Run the test suite and paste the output.

Output a structured debug report:
```
DEBUG REPORT
════════════════════════════════════════
Symptom:         [what the user observed]
Root cause:      [what was actually wrong]
Fix:             [what was changed, with file:line references]
Evidence:        [test output, reproduction attempt showing fix works]
Regression test: [file:line of the new test]
Related:         [TODOS.md items, prior bugs in same area, architectural notes]
Status:          DONE | DONE_WITH_CONCERNS | BLOCKED
════════════════════════════════════════
```

Log the investigation as a learning for future sessions. Use `type: "investigation"` and include the affected files so future investigations on the same area can find this:

```bash
 '{"skill":"investigate","type":"investigation","key":"ROOT_CAUSE_KEY","insight":"ROOT_CAUSE_SUMMARY","confidence":9,"source":"observed","files":["affected/file1.ts","affected/file2.ts"]}'
```

## Capture Learnings

If you discovered a non-obvious pattern, pitfall, or architectural insight during
this session, log it for future sessions:

```bash
 '{"skill":"investigate","type":"TYPE","key":"SHORT_KEY","insight":"DESCRIPTION","confidence":N,"source":"SOURCE","files":["path/to/relevant/file"]}'
```

**Types:** `pattern` (reusable approach), `pitfall` (what NOT to do), `preference`
(user stated), `architecture` (structural decision), `tool` (library/framework insight),
`operational` (project environment/CLI/workflow knowledge).

**Sources:** `observed` (you found this in the code), `user-stated` (user told you),
`inferred` (AI deduction), `cross-model` (both Claude and Codex agree).

**Confidence:** 1-10. Be honest. An observed pattern you verified in the code is 8-9.
An inference you're not sure about is 4-5. A user preference they explicitly stated is 10.

**files:** Include the specific file paths this learning references. This enables
staleness detection: if those files are later deleted, the learning can be flagged.

**Only log genuine discoveries.** Don't log obvious things. Don't log things the user
already knows. A good test: would this insight save time in a future session? If yes, log it.



---

## Important Rules

- **3+ failed fix attempts → STOP and question the architecture.** Wrong architecture, not failed hypothesis.
- **Never apply a fix you cannot verify.** If you can't reproduce and confirm, don't ship it.
- **Never say "this should fix it."** Verify and prove it. Run the tests.
- **If fix touches >5 files → AskUserQuestion** about blast radius before proceeding.
- **Completion status:**
  - DONE — root cause found, fix applied, regression test written, all tests pass
  - DONE_WITH_CONCERNS — fixed but cannot fully verify (e.g., intermittent bug, requires staging)
  - BLOCKED — root cause unclear after investigation, escalated
